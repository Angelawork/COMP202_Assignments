## Assignment 2 (Oct9)
Question 1: Dungeons! Remember how it was like living in the 80s? I donâ€™t but I heard a lot about it. This was a magical
time when there was no internet as we know it and most computers could not even display graphics on
screen. They could only display text.

## Assignment 3 (Nov9)
Question 1: Fun with images. In this question we will work with greyscale images and perform simple operations on them: flipping,
cropping, inverting, reading from disk, writing to disk, compressing and decompressing. A digital image can be thought of as a two-dimensional grid of pixels: little squares, each with their own colour, arranged in rows and columns.
