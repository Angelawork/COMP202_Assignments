## Assignment 2 (Oct9)
Question 1: Dungeons! Remember how it was like living in the 80s? I donâ€™t but I heard a lot about it. This was a magical
time when there was no internet as we know it and most computers could not even display graphics on
screen. They could only display text.

## Assignment 3 (Nov9)
Question 1: Fun with images. In this question we will work with greyscale images and perform simple operations on them: flipping,
cropping, inverting, reading from disk, writing to disk, compressing and decompressing. A digital image can be thought of as a two-dimensional grid of pixels: little squares, each with their own colour, arranged in rows and columns.

## Assignment 4 (Nov26)
Question 1: Paying It Forward. An Application Programming Interface, or API for short, is a way for two or more computer
programs to communicate with each other. An API is comprised of a formal specification, describing how the communication is done, and an implementation, which implements the communication process in code

Question 2: Making Melodies. A music melody is made up of a series of notes. Each note has a pitch (a letter ranging from A to G)
and a duration. Each note is also located in a particular octave from 1 to 7. Higher octaves correspond
to a higher frequency. For example, C4 has a higher frequency than C3. Finally, notes may also have
accidentals (sharps or flats) that make them sound different than regular notes. Music also has silences
which are called rests
